I am a final year PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Oxford (Balliol College), supervised by Harry Desmond, Julien Devriendt, and Adrianne Slyz. I specialize in Bayesian field-level inference and digital twins of the local Universe to bridge observations and theory. My research combines constrained cosmological simulations, semi-analytic galaxy formation models, simulation-based inference, and machine learning to test galaxy physics, map large-scale flows, and deliver precision measurements of cosmological parameters. I tackle distance-ladder cosmology, reconstruct the initial conditions of the Universe, probe the galaxy–halo connection, and explore the interface between cosmology, gravitational-wave astronomy, and machine learning.

Beyond astrophysical applications, I develop and apply advanced statistical methods to extract robust insights from complex datasets. I work extensively with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and gradient-based samplers for scalable Bayesian inference, particularly hierarchical and field-level models that exploit these techniques. On the machine learning side, I use graph-based methods and geometric deep learning to capture physical structure. More broadly, I employ simulation-based inference, normalizing flows, and Gaussian processes to quantify uncertainties and reveal underlying physics.
