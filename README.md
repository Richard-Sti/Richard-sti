I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford, specializing in understanding the large-scale structure of the local Universe through constrained cosmological simulations. I also work on smaller-scale astrophysical phenomena, such as galaxy evolution, galactic rotation curves, and gravitational-wave astronomy.

My work combines both theoretical physics and the running of simulations that require high-performance computing facilities. Additionally, I incorporate various aspects of Bayesian inference and machine learning into my research.
