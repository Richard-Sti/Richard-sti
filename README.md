I am a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford. I concentrate on devising novel tests of physics through the use of constrained cosmological simulations. In addition, my research encompasses galaxy kinematics, the galaxy-halo connection, and the strong-field lensing of gravitational waves. My other areas of expertise include machine learning, Bayesian inference and high-performance computing.
